After fukushima we wanted to have a geigercounter @shackspace but never pulled through.
When a few of us stumbled upon some radioactive material in prague the topic had our
attention again and so I started a fundraiser and am seeing this through.

We settled on the radiation@home v.2.261 since it provided what we were looking for
and was [readily available](http://radioactiveathome.org/boinc/forum_thread.php?id=460).

makefu and I thought it needed some more opensource flavour and so we made a [first BOM](http://radioactiveathome.org/boinc/forum_thread.php?id=471)
for others to use.
Here is now the corrected version ![(tested by Karlos and Alex)](https://raw.github.com/excogitation/radiation-at-home/master/pics/opengeiger_v_2.61.jpg)

[1clickbom](http://1clickbom.com/) compatible bill of materials.

Total cost so far about:
25€ for the preassembled v. 2.61 kit
~15€ for the missing parts (we had to get the wrong parts from the [local pharmacy](www.conrad.de).
__80€ für 2 kits
